# The Odin Project

## Description

The Odin Project is a free, online, open-source coding curriculum. Nearly 800,000 people have used this resource.

[//]: # "-What was your motivation?"
[//]: # "Why did you build this project?"
[//]: # "What problem does it solve?"

I intend to use this free resource to augment and solidify the Web Development skills I gain through my M-CS at UIS.

The Odin Project is a project-based curriculum, so it will provide me more opportunities to build practical programs that put my skills and knowledge to the test, making me a more well-rounded developer.
